To replicate the results, please run the code scripts in subsequent orders from code script named run4 series to run24 series. run1-run3 series are no longer used but is provided alongside for completeness and integrity of the code system.

Script run4_modern_climateniche.m downloads and processes modern datasets, including downscaled CHELSA datasets

Script run5_livestock.m process data on modern livestock distribution data 

Script run5_montecarlo.m conducts monte-carlo analysis

Script run6_future.m downloads and processes future climate datasets and land use datasets to estimate future niches.
run6_future_regional.m conducts continental re-analysis with a similar procedure to run6_future.m.

Script run7_analysis.m performs analysis on above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, and overgrazing analysis

Script run8_analysis_future.m performs further niche analysis in future climate scenarios

Script run8_analysis_future_regional.m performs regional niche analysis for future climate scenarios

Script run9_figures_all.m creates figures 

Script run10_modernniche.m performs analysis using modern livestock distribution data to determine the niche

Script run11_latlon_future.m and run12_latlon_modern.m performs longitudinal and latitudinal analysis 

Script run13_figures_allnew.m creates more figures

Script run14_presentfuture_climate_compare.m compares the differences between the temperature between 2100 and present

Script run15_latitude.m calculates the latitude dispersion of grassland for present and future

Script run16_impacted_poplivestock_2100.m calculates the turnover impact on population and livestock figure

Script run16_impacted_poplivestock_2100_sensitivity.m calculates the uncertainty for the impacted population using the widest and thinnest thresholds

Script run17_sensitiviti_all_cattle.m, run17_sensitiviti_all_sheep.m, and run17_sensitivity_all_goats.m calculates the sensitivity analysis for different livestock species

Script run17_sensitivity_all_turnover.m calculates the turnover rate of future and present niche

Script run18_continental_presentniche.m conducts continental re-analysis, as for all run18 series scripts.

Script run19_continental_futureniche.m performs reanalysis for continental turnover.

Script run20 calculates the reanalysis for using alternate CMIP dataset to replace CHELSA dataset

Script run21_newniche_MRIdata.m conducts sensitivity analysis for using alternative climate datasets to calculate niche

Script run23_presentfuture_climate_compare_MRI.m compares the differences between the temperature between 2100 and present using the same set of MRI data

Script run22_turnover_MRIdata.m uses alternative climate dataset to calculate the turnover

Script run24_species_specific_heatmap.m produces species-specific heatmaps

Script run25_treemap_2100.R creates heatmaps in Fig. 3

%Not needed: Script run1_historical_simulation.m downloads and process the historical climate data for the variable 'pr', 'tas', 'hurs', 'sfcWind' from CMIP, and land use data from HYDE database. Script run1_historical_simulation_regional.m conducts region-specific reanalysis using historical data, run1_sensitivity_timeframe.m tests the sensitivity of the historical timeframe chosen. Script run2_2newclimate.m and run3_5historical_climate.m add more climate data to the ensemble and conduct niche analysis using historical climate and grazing data.

Key scripts:
run13_figures_allnew has the scatter plots that are in Figure 1.
run10 calculates the livestock niche, the cattle niche, sheep niche, and goats niche
run17_sensitiviti_all_turnover calculates the turnover of average, wide, and thinnest thresholds. This results in figure2
run16_impacted_poplivestock_2100 and run16_impacted_poplivestock_2100_uncertainty calculate the results for figure3, which results in the impacted population with uncertainty ranges

Additional key sensitivity analysis scripts:
run18 calculatest the continental niche
run20 calculates the reanalysis for using alternate CMIP dataset to replace CHELSA dataset
run24 produces species-specific heatmaps
run25 creats treemap in Figure 3

Dependencies required   
For Matlab, our scripts require the dependencies require the climate toolbox (https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/171331090), land mask, and addcolorplus package. All scripts were run in version Matlab_R2021b environment. For any further questions please feel free to contact: Li.Chaohui@pik-potsdam.de
